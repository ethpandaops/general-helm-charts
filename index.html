A set of generic [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts managed and maintained by the [EthPandaOps team](https://github.com/ethpandaops).

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
helm repo add ethpandaops-general-helm-charts https://ethpandaops.github.io/general-helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run the following command to see the charts.

```sh
helm search repo ethpandaops-general-helm-charts
```
